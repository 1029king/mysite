    <h1>TESTING</h1>
    <h1 class="mysite">hello</h1>
    <p>Uh, uh-uh, uh, uh
Oh, do you do this often?
I know it sound wrong, like, everything I left in Maryland
I just don't wanna see myself anymore, I don't
(Do you do this often? Do you do this often?)
They like, they say they miss me and shit, shut up, for real, like, man
(Do you do this often? Do you do this often?)
Okay, I don't mean to say some shit, you know I don't often do this-
(Do you do this often?)
Look (do you do this often?), 'kay
DJ, run it back, play my song in this bitch
Vibin' like I'm alone in this bitch, mm
Tit-for-tat, I got your back, was I wrong for that shit?
Tell me, is we too grown for that shit? Uh
I wanna lock it in, baby, no weighin' my options
Wanna travel, see the world, gettin' drunk on an island
Wanna settle, start a family, so tell me about it
And you so perfect, baby, don't give nobody that body
Okay, social anxiety, I fear
And I done been this way for some years
I don't really get along with my peers
Everything that they do to me is weird
So, in a world full of weirdos, fools, and scrubs
Tell me, what is it you're willin' to do for love?
You know it's true that the datin' pool is fucked
Ain't nobody out here, baby, it just be us
And I know, and I know, and I know
And I know a broken heart when I see one
And I feel, and I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I love you more
Did you know? Do you know? Did you know?
Do you know I'm a shoulder if you need one?
When I feel what I feel, keep it real, what's the deal? I'm ready for
Oh (oh-oh), somewhere (somewhere) we could be alone (oh-oh-oh)
You and me alone (oh-oh-oh)
I remember bein' 21 when my life had just begun
22, many things to see and do
23, lookin' forward to 24
Is it just me, or it ain't no love no more?
25, what a time to be alive
Am I getting old? Why do I feel tired?
All the same old things, the same old games
Same old pain, think it's time for a change 'cause
Certain shit ain't like me no more
Certain shit don't excite me no more
It don't excite no more, no
It ain't like me no more
No more (no more), no more (no more)
No, no, no, no, no (do you do this often?)
Certain shit don't excite me no more
Shit ain't like me no more (do you do this often?)
This ain't like me no more, no
It don't excite me no more, uh (do you do this often?)
Ooh-uh (often, do you do this often?)</p>
